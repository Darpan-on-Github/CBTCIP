Title: Cipherbyte Technologies Internship Repository

Description:
This repository contains Python code for two data science tasks completed during an internship:

1 : Iris Flower Classification using Random Forest: Classifies Iris flowers based on sepal and petal measurements using a Random Forest model.
2 : Spam Mail Detection: Builds a model to distinguish spam from legitimate emails.

Requirements:
Python 3.x (Recommended: Use a virtual environment for project isolation.)
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn (for Iris Classification), nltk (for Spam Detection)
Google Colab (for code execution and dataset upload)

Open each Python file (e.g., Iris_Flower_Classif.ipynb, Spam Mail Detection.ipynb) in a separate Colab notebook cell.
Execute the cells one by one (use the "Run" button or keyboard shortcuts).

Note:
- Ensure the datasets are in the csv format, and should be uploded first to the colab envoirnment and then cells should be executed.
- The csv files name might be changed in the code, so rename the file once you upload it in the colab envoirnment.
